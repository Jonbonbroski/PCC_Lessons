With the last lesson, we were reviewing some of the ways that we can send information to the routes inside our node server using the request object. Then, from the information received, we were able to change what we returned in our response.

For this lesson, we are going to review some additional ways we can use the request object to send information. However, this time we are going to be including the different route methods (GET,POST,PUT DELETE) so that we can make changes to data before returning it. This will help solidify using the methods appropriately so that we will be ready to start implementing them on an actual database. 

We will also be reviewing some additional things about node, express and files that may be involved when using it.
You can move on to the server.js file. Note: the server-1.js file does not have an index.html connected to it. There will be one connected to the server-2.js file though.
