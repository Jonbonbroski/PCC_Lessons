    <!-- Below, we have made four basic buttons, each with a simple onclick function.
    The functions are defined below in the script tag. Each function contains
    a fetch request which is one of the AJAX methods for making a query. 
    When our server is running, we can open this html and click the buttons 
    to see what happens in the developer tools. Check out the functions below.
    After you understand this information clearly, then you can continue onto
    server-2.js. -->


    <h1>Click buttons below to make a request.</h1>
    <p>Open up the developer tools to see the responses in the console</p>
    
    <button onclick="getFunction()">GET</button>
    <button onclick="postFunction()">POST</button>
    <button onclick="putFunction()">PUT</button>
    <button onclick="deleteFunction()">DELETE</button>
</body>

<script>

//Each of these methods are the exact same. The only difference is that that 
//the "method" has changed from GET POST PUT and DELETE for each one. 
//You will notice each one is sending a request to the exact same url. 
//In this case, it is "http:localhost:" because it is out own computer
//and then says "5000" becuase that is the port we are using for the 
//server to run on in our server-1.js.

//This also shows that we are using different methods on the same endpoint as well. 
//When you check the console after clicking one of the buttons, you should see an
//object appear in the console that has our json objects which can be found in the 
//routes in the server-1.js since that is what we are senging as a response. 


//GET method function
const getFunction = () =>{
    fetch("http://localhost:5000",
    {
        method:"GET"
    })
    .then((response)=>{console.log(response.json())})
    .catch((err)=>{console.log(err)})
};

//POST method function
const postFunction = () =>{

    fetch("http://localhost:5000",
    {
        method:"POST"
    })
    .then((response)=>{console.log(response.json())})
    .catch((err)=>{console.log(err)})
};

//PUT method function
const putFunction = () =>{

    fetch("http://localhost:5000",
    {
        method:"PUT"
    })
    .then((response)=>{console.log(response.json())})
    .catch((err)=>{console.log(err)})
};

//DELETE method function
const deleteFunction = () =>{

    fetch("http://localhost:5000",
    {
        method:"DELETE"
    })
    .then((response)=>{console.log(response.json())})
